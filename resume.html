			<h2>Profile</h2> 
			<p>
				I'm a senior at Eastern Washington University in the technical communication program with a minor in visual Communication Design. In technical communication we usually work with subject matter experts such as engineers, technicians, or scientists. Technical Communicators create, design, edit, and produce a variety of documents including software and equipment manuals, maintenance procedures, sales promotion materials, organizational policies and procedures, informative articles, websites (both front and back end), and assembly instructions.The purpose of technical communication is not to entertain people.I enjoy writing and working with computers and with this major you are able to use both of those skills together. My main focus with technical communication is the writing and editing part with some background knowledge in visual communication.
