			<h1> Major</h1>
					
					<p> I'm a senior at Eastern Washington University in the technical communication program with a minor in visual Communication Design. In technical communication we usually work with subject matter experts such as engineers, technicians, or scientists. Technical Communicators create, design, edit, and produce a variety of documents including software and equipment manuals, maintenance procedures, sales promotion materials, organizational policies and procedures, informative articles, websites (both front and back end), and assembly instructions.The purpose of technical communication is not to entertain people.
			    	I enjoy writing and working with computers and with this 	major you are able to use both of those skills together
			    	My main focus with technical communication is the writing and editing part with some background knowledge in visual communication.</p>

				<h3>More Info</h3>

				<p>I work at Mountain View Gymnastics in Airway Heights and have been there for the past 5 years. I started doing gymnastics when I was 5 and went all the way through high school before I started to coach. I absolutely love my job. My parents own the gym so I basically live there.I love books! If I could get a job where I could just read all day I would be so happy.</p>
